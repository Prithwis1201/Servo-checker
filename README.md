# Servo-checker
Many times due to faulty C++ code we believe that our servos are not working, This code is to solve that problem by checking the servo is working or not by sweeping them.

To execute this code, go to arduino IDE and save this code and then upload it to the arduino.

Connect the servo to pin 9 of the Arduino and power it on.

If servo is all right, It will move left and right, If servo is not working it will show some issue.
